      Use bootstrap grid to show lyrics side by side. col-md-6, col-md-6
      Use another grid to compare the two lyrics and decide theft or homage to the right. col-md-10, col-md-2
      Maybe put those two grids in a container or something. container or container-fluid

            p.text-indent Jay-Z and Biggie both grew up on the east coast, where most rappers and rap groups are tightly knit, aside from a few. Jay-Z is notorious (no pun intended) for biting, or stealing without credit, Biggie's lines. Many would say that he is paying homage to the late Biggie, however there are many other things to consider. Usually when a rapper pays homage, he usually uses a well-known line to let his fans know that he is blatantly paying homage. Lyrics are usually stolen from lines that are "buried" in a song. This is a perfect example, especially since these lyrics were copied verbatim. If Jay-Z really felt the need to pay homage to Biggie, he would have taken a line such as "It was all a dream, I used to read word up magazine" or "I love it when you call me Big Poppa", which are very popular lines in some of Biggie's songs.

               | Everything about these two lines are very similar, even the song titles: "No More Pain" vs. "Bring the Pain". Unlike the last comparison we looked at, 2Pac did not copy the lines verbatim. 2Pac uses "...to the brain" while Method Man used "...from the brain", both of which give their respective lines entirely different meanings. Now, it could definitely be argued that since 2Pac was from the west coast and Method Man was from the east coast, that these lyrics were obviously stolen due to the rivalry. However, in this particular case, that's very untrue. "Bring The Pain" was one of Method Man's biggest hits. Like we talked about earlier, rappers usually pay homage when taking lines from popular songs. Also, the late 2Pac had also collaborated with Meth on his album
               i  All Eyez On Me,
               |  which eliminated any speculation of a rivalry. But it goes even deeper than that.

               | This comparison is much more obvious than the others, however it's very important to explain the reference. The song C.R.E.A.M. by Wu-tang Clan has been referenced by numerous rappers since the release of the album
               i  Enter the Wu-tang: 36 Chambers
               |  in 1993 by the Wu-tang Clan. The phrase "Cash Rules Everything Around Me" has also been a huge pop culture reference since the album's release. It is used so much, that it's almost as if the word and phrase are in public domain. Interestingly enough, Akon's line in "Sweetest Girl" is a double reference. Biggie and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony collaborated on the song "Notorious Thugs" off of Biggie's album
               i  Life After Death
               |  , where Biggie had a very similar line to Akon: "I'mma tell you like a n*gga told me, Cash Rules Everything Around Me". While the semantics of Akon's line and Biggie's line are very similar, the reference above is much more important to outline. Akon's line, without question, is paying homage to the influential rap group, Wu-tang Clan.
